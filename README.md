## Description

A solution for the Pleo frontend-challenge (https://github.com/pleo-io/frontend-challenge)

## Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Redux
- Babel
- webpack
- styled-components

## Use

- run `npm install` followed by `npm start` at root and /api

## Notes 

- Decided to make my own table component due to the limited features needed. Could substitute later with react-table.
- expenseTable state in component vs. redux: decided on redux to persist pagination and easier access for other components
